/**
 An ErrorHandler is responsible for handling an error by executing one or more actions, that are found to match the error.
 
 You can add the rules for matching and the actions that will be executed when a match occurs by using the `on(_:do)` method variants.
 
 You can add actions to be executed when there is no match with the onNoMatch(do:) method and actions that will be executed regardless of whether there is a match or not with `always(do:).`

     Defines an action to be executed if the error handled by the error handler metches the `matches` function.
     - Parameters:
         - matches: If this closure returns true, the `action` parameter will be executed.
         - action: The closure that will be executed if `matches` returns true. The action returns a `MatchingPolicy` instance. If the action is called and returns `MatchingPolicy.continueMatching`, the error handle continues to execute the actions corresponding to other potential matches for the handled error. If the action is called and returns `MatchingPolicy.stopMatching` no other matching action is executed, except actions defined with the `always(do:)` method.
     - Returns: The updated error handler (self).
     - Note: When the `handle` method is called the matching functions are called in lifo order. First is checked the `matches` function given by the last `on(matches:do:)` call. The reasoning behind this is that the last `on(matches:do:)` call is the last customization made to the handler by the developer and as such, it's action should have priority if there are multiple matches.
